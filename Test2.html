        <h3>What Is Nutrition...?</h3>
   Have you ever heard the expression, 'you are what you eat?' While we can't take this literally, this simple saying contains a lot of truth.The foods you choose to eat determine which nutrients your body will receive and in what quantities. Nutrients are substances that allow your body to make energy, build and maintain tissues, and regulate bodily processes. If you eat a healthy diet filled with a variety of high-nutrient foods, you are more likely to enjoy good health than if you eat a poor diet that is lacking in nutrients. This lesson will provide an overview of nutrition, which is the process of taking in nutrients from foods, by looking at the six classes of nutrients:Carbohydrates,Lipids,Proteins,Water,Vitamins,MineralsWhat is good nutrition?
Good nutrition means your body gets all the nutrients, vitamins, and minerals it needs to work its best. Plan your meals and snacks to include nutrient-dense foods that are also low in calories.
